        <h2> I did my master’s degree in Applied Design (Control and Robotics) at K.N Toosi University of Technology. I did my final thesis on the “ Design and Fabrication of a Soft Robotic Arm for Upper Limb Rehabilitation” under the supervision of Prof. S. Ali Akbar Moosavian. The scope of my research included design of soft pneumatic glove and analysis of brain signals responsible for hand’s motion whereby I could model this motion.
        My research interest includes Robotics, Control, Bioengineering, Machine Learning, and Dynamics. I specifically focus on Rehabilitation Robotics and soft robots. </h2>
